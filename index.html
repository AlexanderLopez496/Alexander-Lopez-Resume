        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alexander Jouse Lopez, but you can just call me Alex! I am a born and raised southern Californian, and I currently live in Corona. I have been video and film editing for over 5 years now, and I am currently studying the art at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        I started editing film and video since 2015 when I was still enrolled in middle school. I was always fascinated by film and television, but I never knew how any of my favorite television shows or movies were made. That was until I got my first laptop, which was intended strictly for schoolwork, but it slowly became my first workstation. Luckily for me, I had enough spare time during the weekends to shoot and compile footage on Friday, and then spend my entire Saturday morning editing away at videos and films nobody watched. Even though my friend's and family struggled to watch my films and video, they still supported my weekend hobby.<br><br>

        Having graduated from high school, I am continuing my video and film career by studying at the University of California, Riverside. I am very blessed to study at an institution that I have been working towards since I was just a child. I am the first man in my family to obtain a higher education, and I hope I can become a role model to the rest of my family. I want to show others that it is possible to obtain a higher education. I also hope that I can obtain a career in the film and digital production industry as it will open new doors to what is possible in my life. As for my college career, this is just the beginning. During my first quarter of Univeristy, I managed to work on a theatre production. Something that I am very proud of since I have never worked in the field of theatre until I joined the play's production team. I can only hope that I get to experience the full theatre experience once we return to normal, and once we return to campus. For my second quarter of my freshman year, I was invited to work on another digital production. Because of my work from my theatre production, I was invited to work for a committee on my school's campus. A committee that I am still a part of and still work for a couple of months now. I am thankful that I was invited into the committee as I have worked with them to create a popular podcast discussing mental health. From here, I can only hope that my college career will only get higher.
